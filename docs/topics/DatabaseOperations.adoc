== Storing a Database File
The database file that you create might contain highly sensitive data and must be stored in a very secure way. You must make sure that the database is always protected with a strong and long password. The database file that is protected with a strong and long password is secure and encrypted while stored on your computer or cloud storage service.

Make sure that the database file is stored in a folder that is secure. Make sure that you or someone else does not accidentally delete the database file. Deletion of the database file will result in the total loss of your information and a lot of inconvenience to manually retrieve your logins for  various web applications. You must not share your database file with anyone unless absolutely necessary.

==  Backing up a Database File
It is a good practice to create copies of your database file and store the copies of your database on different computer, smart phone, or cloud storage space such a Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive.

Creating backups for your database give you a peace of mind should you lose one copy of your database. You can quickly retrieve the copy of your database and start using it.
