== Interface Overview
=== Application Layout
The KeePassXC interface is designed for simplicity and easy access to your information. The main database view is split into three main partitions detailed below. You can open multiple databases at the same time, they will appear in tabs.

*(A) Groups* - Organize your entries into discrete groups to bring order to all of your sensitive information. Groups can be nested under each other to create a heirarchy. Settings from parent groups get applied to their children.

*(B) Entries* - Entries contain all the information for each website or application you are storing in KeePassXC. This view shows all the entries in the selected group. Each column can be resized, reordered, and shown or hidden based on your preference. Right click the header row to see all available options.

*\(C) Preview* - Shows a preview of the selected group or entry. You can temporarily hide this preview using the close button on the right hand side or completely disabled in the application settings.

TIP: Double clicking on the text in the entries list copies that field to the clipboard. Double clicking the entry title will open the entry for editing.

=== Toolbar
The toolbar provides a quick way to perform common tasks with your database. Some entries in the toolbar are dynamically disabled based on the information contained in the selected entry. Every common action in KeePassXC can be controlled with a keyboard shortcut as well.
